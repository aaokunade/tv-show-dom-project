All episodes must be shown
For each episode, AT LEAST following must be displayed:
the episode's name
the season number
the episode number
the episode's medium-sized image
the episode's summary text
You should combine season number and episode number into an episode code:
Each part should be zero-padded to two digits.
Example: S02E07 would be the code for the 7th episode of the 2nd season. S2E7 would be incorrect.
Your page should state somewhere that the data has (originally) come from https://tvmaze.com/, and link back to that site (or the specific episode on that site). See https://www.tvmaze.com/api#licensing.
